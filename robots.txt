1) Write a REST API with token-based authentication and handling various HTTP status codes as per REST standards.
Write API’s for basic CRUD operation on an entities/collection called Agency and client which has below fields. One Agency can have multiple clients.
Agency
AgencyId, Name, Address1, Address2, State, City, Phone Number
Beside Address2 all other fields are required.
	Client
	ClientId, AgencyId, Name, Email, PhoneNumber, TotalBill (all are required fields)
You have to create 3 RESTFUL API’s which will read/write to MongoDB with proper validation.
1st API should create an agency and client in single request
2nd API should update a client detail.
3rd API should return name of agency along with client details which has top client(s) with maximum total bill, below fields should be part of response.
        AgencyName, ClientName, TotalBill

 2) Create a middleware for external REST API’ call.
For the external API’s call you need to use a sample URL (htttps://externalAPI.com/get/ads) and return that data from an internal RESTFUL API endpoint which will be consumed by our front-end app.

N.B  The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate your understanding of architecture and coding standards, your understanding of REST and handling HTTP Status code etc.

Tech stack needs to use: Node.js (any framework which you used and think is best), MongoDB, My SQL etc.
Deliverable:
You have to provide the source code 
Deploy the API’s to a test server along with the database which can be tested by us. 
Documentation of API in an automated way done by tools like swagger etc which can be easily read by front app developers.
Architecture diagram of the app.
